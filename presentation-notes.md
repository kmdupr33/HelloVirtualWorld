pt 1: background

OVRUI—OVRUI is a user interface library that provides a set of geometry types for Three.js, helping you build UIs in VR. Geometry objects describe text, buttons and other content that can be displayed within a 3D scene. For the pre-release, this is written primarily to support the requirements of React VR, but we’ll be developing this and placing it separately on GitHub so that this library can be used in its own right. More documentation on the direct use of OVRUI will follow.

Player
When you create a new React VR project, “react-vr init” script generates some boilerplate initialization code that makes use of an OVRUI component known as the Player. Player acts as a window into your 3D world, setting up the initial Three.js scene and displaying overlay widgets such as the compass and the “View in VR”button.
